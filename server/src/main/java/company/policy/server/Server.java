/**
 * This class implements a server that listens on port 8080 for incoming client
 * connections.
 * <p>
 * When a client connects, the server generates a UUID for the client and adds
 * it to a map that stores the UUID and corresponding socket for each client.
 * Then, the server submits a new task to an executor to handle the client's
 * requests. The task reads an object from the client's input stream, gets a
 * list of all sockets except the current one from the map, and writes the
 * object to all other sockets. Finally, the task removes the client's UUID from
 * the map and closes the socket.
 * <p>
 * The code uses a fixed thread pool executor to handle multiple clients
 * concurrently. This is achieved by submitting new tasks to the executor for
 * each client that connects to the server. The use of a ConcurrentHashMap to
 * store the UUID and socket for each client ensures thread safety.
 * <p>
 * The code also handles exceptions such as EOFException, IOException, and
 * ClassNotFoundException that may occur when reading objects from the client's
 * input stream or writing objects to the sockets of other clients. The code
 * logs appropriate messages at different levels of severity depending on the
 * exception.
 * <p>
 * It's implementation is basic in that allows multiple clients to communicate
 * with each other using objects, however, there are a few areas for
 * improvement, such as adding more error handling and implementing a more
 * efficient way of sending objects to other clients, such as using a
 * publish-subscribe messaging system.
 * <p>
 * To implement a publish-subscribe messaging system, we can use a library such
 * as Apache ActiveMQ or Eclipse Mosquitto. Here's an example of how we can
 * modify the existing code to use ActiveMQ:
